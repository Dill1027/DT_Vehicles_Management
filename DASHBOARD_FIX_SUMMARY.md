# Dashboard Fix Summary 🔧

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ **Original Error**
```
Error fetching dashboard data: TypeError: _services_vehicleService__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__.vehicleService.getExpiredVehicles is not a function
```

### 2. 🔧 **Root Cause**
The dashboard (`Dashboard_old.js`) was calling methods that didn't exist in our static services:
- `notificationService.getExpiringVehicles(30)`
- `notificationService.getExpiredVehicles()`
- `reportService.downloadVehicleSummaryReport()`
- `reportService.downloadExpiryAlertsReport()`

### 3. ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

#### **A. Updated Notification Service (`notificationService.js`)**
- ✅ Replaced API calls with localStorage-based mock implementations
- ✅ Added `getExpiringVehicles()` method that checks insurance/registration expiry dates
- ✅ Added `getExpiredVehicles()` method that finds vehicles with expired documents
- ✅ Added mock implementations for all other notification methods
- ✅ Calculates expiry dates dynamically based on current date

#### **B. Updated Report Service (`reportService.js`)**
- ✅ Replaced API calls with mock PDF generation (creates text files for demo)
- ✅ Added `downloadVehicleSummaryReport()` method using mock vehicle data
- ✅ Added `downloadExpiryAlertsReport()` method with expiry calculations
- ✅ Added mock implementations for maintenance reports and custom reports
- ✅ Added `getReportStatistics()` method returning mock statistics

#### **C. Enhanced Mock Data (`mockDataService.js`)**
- ✅ Added realistic expiry dates to vehicle data:
  - Vehicle DT-001: Insurance expiring 2025-03-15, Registration expiring 2025-02-28
  - Vehicle DT-002: Insurance expiring 2025-01-15 (expiring soon), Registration expiring 2025-01-25 (expiring soon)
  - Vehicle DT-003: Insurance expired 2024-12-25, Registration expired 2024-11-15
- ✅ Creates proper test data for dashboard alerts

### 4. 🎯 **Dashboard Features Now Working**

#### **Stats Cards**
- ✅ Total Vehicles count
- ✅ Available/In Use/Maintenance status counts
- ✅ Expiring Soon count (within 30 days)
- ✅ Expired count

#### **Alert Cards**
- ✅ Red alert for expired documents
- ✅ Yellow alert for documents expiring soon
- ✅ Dynamic counts based on actual data

#### **Recent Vehicles Table**

#### **Document Expiry Alerts**
- ✅ Lists vehicles with expired documents (red background)

#### **Report Generation**
- ✅ Vehicle Summary Report (downloads text file with vehicle data)
- ✅ Expiry Alerts Report (downloads text file with expiry information)
- ✅ Mock PDF generation for demo purposes

### 5. 📊 **Sample Data Created**
```
DT-001: Normal expiry dates
DT-002: Expiring soon (within 30 days)
DT-003: Already expired documents
```

### 6. 🚀 **Result**
- ✅ Dashboard loads without errors
- ✅ All statistics display correctly
- ✅ Expiry alerts show proper data
- ✅ Report downloads work (as text files for demo)
- ✅ Full offline functionality using localStorage
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ Ready for Netlify deployment

---
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Dashboard now fully functional with mock data!
