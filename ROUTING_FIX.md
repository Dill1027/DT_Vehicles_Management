# ðŸ”§ ROUTING FIX APPLIED

## Problem
The React frontend was showing "Page not found" error when:
- Refreshing the page
- Entering URLs directly (like /add-vehicle)
- Navigating to any route other than the root

## Root Cause
The `_redirects` file was empty, so Netlify didn't know how to handle SPA (Single Page Application) routing properly.

## Solution Applied
Added the correct redirect rule to `public/_redirects`:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This tells Netlify to serve the `index.html` file for all routes, allowing React Router to handle the routing client-side.

## Status
âœ… `_redirects` file fixed and deployed
âœ… Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
âœ… Netlify auto-deployment triggered

## Testing
Now you can:
1. **Refresh any page** - should work
2. **Enter URLs directly** - should work  
3. **Navigate between routes** - should work

## Test URLs
- Root: https://strong-seahorse-77cbee.netlify.app
- Vehicles: https://strong-seahorse-77cbee.netlify.app/vehicles
- Add Vehicle: https://strong-seahorse-77cbee.netlify.app/add-vehicle
- Dashboard: https://strong-seahorse-77cbee.netlify.SETUP.app/dashboard

All routes should now work properly! ðŸŽ‰
