# Vercel Authentication Issue Resolution

## Problem
The Vercel backend deployment is requiring authentication for all API routes, preventing the frontend from accessing the backend API. This is due to a project-level protection setting in Vercel.

## Current Backend URL
https://server-6nxirk4qg-dill1027s-projects.vercel.app

## Solution Steps

### Option 1: Disable Vercel Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to the "server" project
3. Go to Project Settings
4. Look for "Password Protection" or "Deployment Protection" section
5. Disable any password protection or authentication requirements
6. The API should then be accessible without authentication

### Option 2: Alternative Deployment Platform
If Vercel protection cannot be disabled, we can deploy to Railway or Render:

#### Railway Deployment:
```bash
cd server
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

#### Render Deployment:
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Create a new Web Service
4. Select the server folder
5. Set build command: `npm install`
6. Set start command: `npm start`

## Environment Variables to Set (whichever platform you choose):
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>`
- `JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>`
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h`

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Backend code is working correctly
- ‚úÖ CORS is properly configured
- ‚úÖ MongoDB connection is set up
- ‚ùå Vercel project protection is blocking API access
- üîÑ Need to disable protection or use alternative platform

## Next Steps
1. Disable Vercel protection OR deploy to alternative platform
2. Update frontend REACT_APP_API_URL to new backend URL
3. Test API connectivity
4. Deploy frontend with updated backend URL

## Test Commands (after fixing protection)
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-backend-url/api/health

# Test vehicles endpoint
curl https://your-backend-url/api/vehicles

# Test with CORS
curl -H "Origin: https://your-frontend-url" https://your-backend-url/api/health
```
