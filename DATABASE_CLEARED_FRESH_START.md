## ✅ **All Data Successfully Cleared**

Your DT Vehicles Management System database has been completely cleared and is now ready for fresh data input through the application forms.

## 🗑️ **What Was Cleared**

### **MongoDB Database:**

## 👤 **System Access**

Since the database is now empty, I've created a **default admin user** to ensure you can access the system:

### **Admin Login Credentials:**
- **Email:** `admin@deeptec.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Role:** Admin (Full Access)
- **Employee ID:** ADMIN001

⚠️ **Important:** Please change this password after your first login for security.
