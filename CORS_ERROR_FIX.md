# 🚨 CORS Error Fix - Frontend Using Wrong Backend URL

## ❌ Problem Identified:
Your frontend is trying to connect to the **old Vercel backend** instead of the **new Netlify backend**:
- ❌ Wrong URL: `https://dt-vehicles-management.vercel.app/api/vehicles`
- ✅ Correct URL: `https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api/vehicles`

## ✅ Solution Applied:
I've fixed the API configuration in your frontend to use the correct Netlify backend URL.

## 🔧 Changes Made:
1. **Updated `client/src/services/api.js`** - Changed fallback URL from Vercel to Netlify
2. **Built the frontend** with the correct configuration
3. **Pushed changes to GitHub** to trigger automatic deployment

## 🚀 Manual Deployment Required:
Since the Netlify CLI has issues, you need to manually trigger the frontend deployment:

### Option 1: Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/strong-seahorse-77cbee
2. Click "Deploy site" or "Trigger deploy"
3. Wait for the build to complete

### Option 2: Git-based Deployment
If your Netlify site is connected to GitHub:
1. The changes were already pushed to GitHub
2. Check if Netlify automatically deploys from the main branch
3. If not, enable auto-deployment in Netlify settings

## 🧪 Test After Deployment:
Once the frontend is redeployed, test:
1. Visit: https://strong-seahorse-77cbee.netlify.app
2. Try to add a vehicle
3. Check the browser console - it should now use `https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api/`

## 🔗 Current Status:
- ✅ Backend working: https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api/health
- ✅ Frontend code fixed (needs deployment)
- ⚠️ Environment variables still need to be set in backend

## 📋 Next Steps:
1. **Deploy frontend** (via Netlify dashboard)
2. **Set environment variables** in backend (https://app.netlify.com/projects/dtvehicle/settings/env-vars)
3. **Test full integration**

---

**The CORS error will be resolved once the frontend is redeployed with the correct backend URL!**
