  - `server/models/User.js`
  - `server/scripts/createDefaultAdmin.js`

- ✅ Updated server.js to remove auth route imports and middleware
- ✅ Removed all authentication/authorization from API routes:

  - `maintenanceRoutes.js` - no auth middleware  
  - `notificationRoutes.js` - simplified and public
- ✅ Removed user references from controllers and services

- ✅ Frontend builds successfully without any errors
- ✅ API endpoints are fully public and accessible
- ✅ Database operations work without user context
- ✅ Vehicle creation/management works through API
- ✅ All pages accessible without login requirements

## 🎯 FINAL STATE

### Backend (Port 5001)
