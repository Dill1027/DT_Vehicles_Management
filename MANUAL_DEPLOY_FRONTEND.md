# 🚨 CRITICAL: Manual Frontend Deployment Required

## ❌ Current Problem:
Your frontend is **STILL using the old Vercel backend URL** because the new build hasn't been deployed yet.

**Error shows:** `POST https://dt-vehicles-management.vercel.app/api/vehicles`  
**Should be:** `POST https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api/vehicles`

## ✅ Solution: Manual Deployment via Netlify Dashboard

Since the Netlify CLI has persistent issues, you need to manually deploy the updated frontend:

### Method 1: Drag & Drop Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com/projects/strong-seahorse-77cbee/deploys

2. **Find the build folder:** `/Users/prabhath/Documents/GitHub/DT_Vehicles_Management/client/build`

3. **Drag the entire `build` folder** onto the Netlify deploy area that says "Drag and drop your site output folder here"

4. **Wait for deployment** to complete

### Method 2: Git-based Deployment

1. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com/projects/strong-seahorse-77cbee/settings/deploys

2. **Link to GitHub repository:**
   - Connect to: `https://github.com/Dill1027/DT_Vehicles_Management`
   - Base directory: `client`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `client/build`

3. **Trigger deployment** manually

### Method 3: ZIP Upload

1. **I've created a zip file:** `frontend-build.zip` in your project root
2. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com/projects/strong-seahorse-77cbee/deploys
3. **Upload the zip file** using the "Deploy manually" option

## 🧪 How to Verify Fix:

After deployment, test:
1. **Visit:** https://strong-seahorse-77cbee.netlify.app
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Try to add a vehicle**
4. **Check console logs** - should show `https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api/` calls

## 🔍 Expected Console Output:
```
🔗 API Configuration: {
  envApiUrl: "https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api",
  baseURL: "https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api"
}
```

## 📋 Current Build Info:
- **New build created:** ✅ (file hash: main.a6b54013.js)
- **Old deployed build:** ❌ (file hash: main.da0485d7.js)
- **Need to deploy:** ✅ New build to replace old one

---

**The CORS error will be fixed once you deploy the new build that uses the correct Netlify backend URL!**

**Choose Method 1 (drag & drop) for fastest deployment.**
