# 🚀 FINAL STEP: Set Environment Variables in Netlify Dashboard

Since the CLI is having issues, please set the environment variables directly in the Netlify dashboard:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Open Netlify Dashboard
**URL:** https://app.netlify.com/projects/dtvehicle/settings/env-vars

### 2. Add Environment Variables
Click "New variable" and add each of these:

**Variable 1:**
- Name: `NODE_ENV`
- Value: `production`

**Variable 2:**
- Name: `MONGODB_URI`  
- Value: `your-actual-mongodb-connection-string`

**Variable 3:**
- Name: `JWT_SECRET`
- Value: `your-actual-jwt-secret-key`

**Variable 4:**
- Name: `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`
- Value: `24h`

### 3. Deploy Site
After adding all variables, click "Deploy site" or "Trigger deploy"

## 🧪 Test After Deployment:

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check (should still work)
curl https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api/health

# Database health (should work after env vars)
curl https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api/health/db

# Vehicles API (should work after env vars)
curl https://dtvehicle.netlify.app/api/vehicles
```

## 🎯 Expected Results:
- Health check: `{"status":"OK","message":"Netlify API is working"}`
- Database health: `{"status":"OK","message":"Database connected successfully"}`
- Vehicles API: `{"success":true,"vehicles":[...]}` or `{"success":true,"vehicles":[]}`

## 🌐 Your Live URLs:
- **Frontend:** https://strong-seahorse-77cbee.netlify.app
- **Backend:** https://dtvehicle.netlify.app

**After setting these environment variables, your full-stack application will be completely functional on Netlify!**
