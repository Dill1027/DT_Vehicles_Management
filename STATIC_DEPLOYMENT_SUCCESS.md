## Key Technical Changes

### New Files Created:
- `client/src/contexts/SimpleAuthContext.js` - Simplified authentication context
- `client/src/services/staticVehicleService.js` - localStorage-based vehicle service
- `client/src/services/mockDataService.js` - Mock data and user service
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration

### Files Modified:
- `client/src/App.js` - Removed ProtectedRoute, uses SimpleAuthContext
- `client/src/services/vehicleService.js` - Now uses static service
- All components updated to use `SimpleAuthContext` instead of `AuthContext`

- **All data persists in localStorage between sessions**

## Deployment Status
- ✅ GitHub repository updated with all changes
