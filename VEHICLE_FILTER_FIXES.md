# Vehicle Filter Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Filter Implementation in Backend Service**
**Problem:** The `staticVehicleService.getAllVehicles()` method was not handling filter parameters (search, status, type) passed from the frontend.

**Fix:** Updated `staticVehicleService.js` to implement client-side filtering:
- **Search Filtering:** Searches across vehicle number, make, model, license plate, department, and notes
- **Status Filtering:** Filters vehicles by their current status
- **Type Filtering:** Filters vehicles by their type (car, truck, van, etc.)
- **Pagination:** Proper pagination with page count and total vehicle count

### 2. **Response Format Mismatch**
**Problem:** The frontend expected a specific response format but the service was returning a simple array.

**Fix:** Updated the service to return a structured response:
```javascript
{
  vehicles: [...],
  totalVehicles: number,
  totalPages: number,
  currentPage: number
}
```

### 3. **Updated Frontend to Handle Both Response Formats**
**Fix:** Modified `Vehicles.js` to handle both structured and simple array responses for backward compatibility.

### 4. **Incorrect Status Filter Options**
**Problem:** Filter dropdown had status options that didn't match the actual vehicle statuses used in the system.

**Fix:** Updated status filter options to match actual system statuses:
- Active
- Available  
- In Use
- In Maintenance
- Inactive
- Retired

### 5. **Added Sample Data for Testing**
**Fix:** Created sample vehicle data with different statuses and types to test filtering functionality:
- 5 sample vehicles with various statuses
- Different vehicle types (car, van, truck)
- Different departments and attributes
