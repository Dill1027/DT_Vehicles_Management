# üö® ROUTING ISSUE DIAGNOSIS

## Current Problem
The frontend routes (like /dashboard, /vehicles) are returning 404 errors instead of serving the React SPA.

## Investigation Results

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Root URL (/) serves the React app correctly
- Build includes _redirects file: `/*    /index.html   200`
- netlify.toml has correct build configuration

### ‚ùå What's Not Working
- All sub-routes return 404
- _redirects file not being applied by Netlify
- SPA fallback routing not functioning

## Attempted Fixes
1. ‚úÖ Added _redirects file to public folder
2. ‚úÖ Verified _redirects copied to build folder  
3. ‚úÖ Tried netlify.toml redirects configuration
4. ‚úÖ Removed conflicting netlify.toml redirects
5. ‚úÖ Multiple redeployments triggered

## Possible Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Manual Netlify Dashboard Configuration
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Site settings ‚Üí Redirects and Rewrites
3. Add rule manually: `/*` ‚Üí `/index.html` (200)

### Option 2: Alternative _redirects Format
Try different formats in the _redirects file:
- `/*  /index.html  200`
- `/* /index.html 200`
- `_redirects` with different spacing

### Option 3: Force Cache Clear
The issue might be Netlify edge caching:
- Clear site cache in Netlify dashboard
- Try with cache-busting parameters

### Option 4: Check Build Output
Verify the build is actually being deployed:
- Check Netlify deploy logs
- Verify _redirects file exists in deployed build

## Next Steps
1. Check Netlify deploy logs for any errors
2. Manually configure redirects in Netlify dashboard
3. Clear site cache
4. Test different _redirects file formats

## Status: INVESTIGATING
The routing issue persists despite multiple attempts. Manual intervention in Netlify dashboard may be required.
